					<p class="exhibition-text-bold">Cosmology</p>
					<p>
						Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The
						Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know
						about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
						constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about
						the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
					</p>
					<p>
						Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab
						traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the
						planets in our solar system.
					</p>
					<p class="exhibition-text-bold">Evolution</p>
					<p>
						For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
						question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
						here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
						framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
					</p>
					<p>
						Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
						know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to
						meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly
						Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.
					</p>
					<p class="exhibition-text-bold">Biology and Medicine</p>
					<p>
						From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
						biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
						the tiny world.
					</p>
					<p>
						For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their
						quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
						understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the
						history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs
						including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart
						transplant.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the
						lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow
						creatures have beat us to it.
					</p>
					<p class="exhibition-text-bold">Robotics and AI</p>
					<p>
						The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
						intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
						applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is
						here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.
					</p>
					<p class="exhibition-text-bold">Ecology</p>
					<p>
						As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
						planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to
						create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole
						planet.
					</p>
					<p>
						In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we
						currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and
						pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
						contribute to a brighter future.
