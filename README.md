# Semester Project 1 - Community Science Museum

Community Science Museum: Semester Project 1 at Noroff FrontEnd Studies.

## Description

Our efforts to apply and combine accumulated competence and showcase how we could complete larger projects, either individually or in collaboration with others using HTML and CSS. I chose to work individually. The brief was making a website for an interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS

## Getting Started

### Installing

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vold-Art/semester-project-1.git
```

```
No dependencies
```

### Running

Since this is a static website using only HTML and CSS, you can run it by simply opening the index.html file in your browser:

Option 1:

Open index.html directly in your browser.

Option 2 (recommended for local development):

Use a live server in your code editor (e.g. Live Server extension in VS Code) to serve the files locally.
